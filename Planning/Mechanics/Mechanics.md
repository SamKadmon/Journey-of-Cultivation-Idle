# Skills 

<hr>

- - Skills Have Proficiency Levels, Ranks, Talent Levels, and Tiers
- Formatted: \[Level: 37 (Novice)] (Talent: 13) \[MORTAL]
- Formatting adjusts as the player learns more and more about the world, initially only knowing the Proficiency level, learning the ranks of the world. When dying and eventually gaining a faint sense of a previous life, unlock Talent levels (Always present but not always visible), and finally unlock Tiers when they find out that there is a world of skill beyond the ken of Qi-less Mortals
- Skill Experience increases faster based on Talent Levels as well as highest achieved Tier, as well as other factors that may affect it such as the circumstances behind the training. 
- Skills increase related stats
